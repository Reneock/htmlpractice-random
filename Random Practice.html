		<div id="introduction">  <p> <span>Democracy is a core value of the United Nations.</span> The UN supports democracy by promoting human rights, development, and peace and security. <br> In the 75 years since the UN Charter was signed, the UN has done more to support democracy around the world than any other global organization. <br> The UN promotes good governance, monitors elections, supports the civil society to strengthen democratic institutions and accountability, <br> ensures self-determination in decolonized countries, and assists in the drafting of new constitutions in post-conflict nations.United Nations activities in support of democracy are carried out through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), <em> the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF) </em>, the Department of Peace Operations (DPO), the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR),and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), among others. </p>  </div>
		<div id="United Nations">  <p> When the <strong> founders of the United Nations </strong> drafted the United Nations Charter, they did not mention the word democracy. In 1945, many of the UN Member States did not endorse democracy as a system, or didn’t practice it. Yet, the opening words of the Charter, “We the Peoples”, reflect the fundamental principle of democracy - that the will of the people is the source of legitimacy of sovereign states and, therefore, of the United Nations as a whole.The UN does not advocate for a specific model of government but promotes democratic governance as a set of values and principles that should be followed for greater participation, equality, security and human development. Democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised. People have a say in decisions and can hold decision-makers to account. Women and men have equal rights and all people are free from discrimination. </p>  </div>
